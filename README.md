# Doom Launcher

A web-based frontend / launcher for gzdoom.

I created this because I wanted a more organized and user-friendly way to get my custom doom games up an running.  Because of the size of the doom community and the number of mods that exist, there are many configuration options which have to be supplied in the correct order, and I was getting tired of editing bash files to accomplish this.  I wanted a way to set up my custom doom games and save them using a drag and drop GUI.


## System Requirements

* Node.js >= 8
* libfluidsynth

The operating system shouldn't matter, as long as it can run Node.js, but I have only tested it on Linux Mint 18.

You'll need libfluidsynth to play the doom midi soundtrack

`sudo apt install libfluidsynth*`


## Roadmap

At some point, I would like to be able to launch any game I want from this tool, though I am not yet seriously trying to plan out how to do that.  I feel that pre-optimization is a bad habit, and want to avoid it on this project.


## TODO

* experiment with yarn
